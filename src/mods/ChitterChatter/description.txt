Currently working on this mod to slowly improve the chat system.

Currently implemented:
- mod icon tags ([mi:ModName]),
- "Chat Source" alternative that shows what mods sent what message (uses the new mod icons),
- chat message timestamps.

These are not configurable for now, but will be in the future.

As for some additional, planned features:
- config for vanilla showing up as a source and config for how the timestamp renders,
- chat message history length (currently made uncapped),
- first-class support for Global Chat (all features currently work though),
- render player's Steam avatar as their chat source,
- better support for emoji, maybe allow embedding images and GIFs, too,
- Discord-like typing indicators,
- general user improvements to writing messages and interacting with them and the UI,
- chat rooms!!!!!
