Forces your tModLoader client to be compatible with vanilla Terraria servers.

This will prevent non-client-side-only (or no-side) mods from being loaded. Do not report these issues to mod developers unless they're truly applicable (you can ask me first).

THIS MOD IS STILL IN ITS TESTING PHASE: I believe all packets should work, but some issues may arise! Notable, tML rewrites ItemCheck logic, so if item usage is weird, please report those issues to me!!

In the future, I'd like to transition this mod to a full rewrite of packet handling on both the client and server, we'll see.
