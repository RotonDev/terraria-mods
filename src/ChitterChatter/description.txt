Currently working on this mod to slowly improve the chat system.

Currently implemented:
- mod icon tags ([mi:ModName]),
- "Chat Source" alternative that shows what mods sent what message (uses the new mod icons),
- chat message timestamps.

These are not configurable for now, but will be in the future.
