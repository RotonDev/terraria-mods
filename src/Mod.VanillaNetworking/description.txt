Forces your tModLoader client to be compatible with vanilla Terraria servers.

This will prevent non-client-side-only (or no-side) mods from being loaded, and will cause errors to be thrown if incompatible data types are loaded. Do not report these issues to mod developers unless they're truly applicable (you can ask me first).
