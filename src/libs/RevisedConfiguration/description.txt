FOR USERS:

"Revised Configuration" is an opinionated library for implementing useful and optimized configuration UIs for various mods.
**It also reimplements vanilla settings in a similar format.**

FOR MODDERS:

Mods may define arbitrary "config entries" implementing an IConfigEntry interface. Config entries are defined and discovered in code.

The API surface is based loosely on Terraria Overhaul's with more abstractions in mind for general use cases.
